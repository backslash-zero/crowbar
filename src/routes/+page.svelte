				The Crow Bar is interactive device tailored specifically to Corvids, aiming to lay the
				ground work for further research into their sensory perception and cognitive abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				The device is designed to not only facilitate in-depth study of Corvids but also to be
				user-friendly and easily replicable for widespread application.
			</p>

				The proposed <strong

				design is meant to leverage Corvidâ€™s remarkable curiosity and problem-solving abilities. The
				Design includes a two-step puzzle which acts as a threshold to discriminate other birds to interact
				with the device.
