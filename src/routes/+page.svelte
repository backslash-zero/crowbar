		<p>
			The Crow Bar is interactive device tailored specifically to Corvids, aiming to lay the ground
			work for further research into their sensory perception and cognitive abilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			The device is designed to not only facilitate in-depth study of Corvids but also to be
			user-friendly and easily replicable for widespread application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The propose open-source design is meant to leverage Corvid’s remarkable curiosity and
			problem-solving abilities. The Design includes a two-step puzzle which acts as a threshold to
			discriminate other birds to interact with the device.
